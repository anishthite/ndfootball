Goal: simpliy data colelction for football coaches, and allow for easy and loal data anlysis:

Phase1: simplify data collection- data can be collected live
Phase2: simple analysis - data can be analyzed by python scripts easily
Phase3: AI will choose hwo to weight the different analysis and predict the ideal play to run by using a LSTM neural net (accouting for running the same play repeatedly)

===============================
Data Collectorv1:

Preplay (yardline, distance, down)
Play (formation and play type)
Results (end result, end ydline, computes gain/loss)

================================
Analytics:

Offense:
simple gainloss
avg gainloss
simple completenss
avg completenss

Defense:

Opp team formation/play
Opp team ball carrier
Opp team results (run/pass)
